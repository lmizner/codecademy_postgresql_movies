# codecademy_postgresql_movies

## Making a Database of Movies
The goals of this project are relatively straightforward: let’s get comfortable using our PostgreSQL client (most likely Postbird) to interact with our PostgreSQL server! In this project, we’ll focus on creating tables, inserting data into those tables, and running some basic queries to see that data.
* Part 1 — Creating Tables
* Part 2 — Saving Our Favorite Movies
* Part 3 — Browsing movies
* Part 4 — Adding Supplementary Information
* Part 5 — Backfilling Data
* Part 6 — Adding Constraints
